The police cordoned off the library while Detective Inspector Calder examined the crime scene. Emma Hart watched from a distance, clutching her bag close. Inside, the table where Mr. Ashford had been found was now just another piece of evidence. His blood had dried to a dark brown stain on the wood, and the dust of centuries seemed disturbed by the violent act.\n\nInside, the table where Mr. Ashford had been found was now just another piece of evidence. His blood had dried to a dark brown stain on the wood, and the dust of centuries seemed disturbed by the violent act. Calder’s men combed the room, yet Emma could sense that whatever the killer had come for was long gone.\n\nCalder approached her. “You were close to Ashford, weren’t you?”\n Emma nodded. “He trusted me with something… though I don’t know what it means yet.”\n Calder studied her face, his eyes sharp but not unkind. “If he gave you anything, you need to tell me now.”"

His brows furrowed.\n “Some of this is in code,” he muttered. “Did Ashford ever mention why?”\n “No. But he said it was important. He was afraid.”\n\nCalder tapped the book with his gloved finger. “If Ashford was killed for this, then whoever wanted it will come looking again. You should keep out of this, Emma.”\n\nEmma didn’t reply. Because she already knew she couldn’t.\n\nChapter 2\n\nBack at her small flat, Emma spread the journal across her desk. The coded passages were maddening—strings of numbers, strange symbols, and Latin words she barely recognized. She searched for patterns, recalling her father’s obsession with puzzles and ciphers.\n\nHer fingers traced the margins until she noticed something odd: tiny ink marks forming a sequence at the bottom of several pages. At first glance they seemed like printing errors, but together they formed a series of coordinates."

They pointed to a place just outside Ravenwood—an abandoned monastery, long shut down and rumored to be haunted.\n\nHer pulse quickened. Why would Ashford’s journal lead her there?\n\nChapter 3\n\nThat evening, unable to resist, Emma drove to the monastery. The structure loomed like a skeleton against the fading sky, its stone walls cracked and swallowed by ivy. She stepped inside, flashlight in hand. The smell of damp stone and rot filled the air.\n\nShe followed the coordinates to a hidden alcove, where a crumbling statue of a saint stood. Something glimmered beneath its base. Emma bent down and brushed away the dirt. Her fingers closed around a small brass box.\n\nBefore she could open it, a noise echoed behind her. Footsteps.\n\nEmma froze. Slowly, she turned her light.\n\nA figure stood in the shadows, tall and unmoving.\n\n“Miss Hart,” a voice drawled, low and chilling. “You shouldn’t have come here.”\n\nHer throat tightened. “Who are you?”\n\nThe man stepped forward, revealing sharp features and a faint scar across his cheek. His eyes glimmered with something between amusement and menace."

The scarred man’s presence filled the cavernous hall, his footsteps echoing softly on the stone floor as he advanced.\n\n“Give it to me,” he said, his voice calm, practiced. “And you walk out of here alive.”\n\nEmma’s pulse thundered in her ears. “What’s inside this box?”\n The man tilted his head. “Knowledge. Power. Things you don’t have the faintest idea about.”\n\nHer instinct screamed to run, but she forced herself to stand tall. “Mr. Ashford died for this. I’m not handing it over.”\n\nThe man’s smile was thin, humorless. “Ashford was a foolish old man who thought he could protect what belonged to us. Don’t make the same mistake.”\n\nHe reached into his coat. For a split second Emma saw the gleam of a blade.\n\nShe didn’t think—she hurled the flashlight at him. The beam cracked against his shoulder, shattering the light, plunging the alcove into near darkness. Emma sprinted toward the monastery’s nave, the box clutched to her chest.\n\nChapter 5"

Behind her, the stranger’s footsteps pounded closer, relentless.\n\nShe darted down a narrow passageway, cobwebs brushing her face, and stumbled into what looked like an old crypt. Rows of crumbling coffins lined the walls. She pressed herself against the cold stone, heart hammering.\n\nSilence.\n\nThen, the man’s voice drifted through the dark, mocking and low.\n “You can’t hide from this, Miss Hart. Once you’ve touched the truth, it never lets you go.”\n\nEmma bit her lip, fighting panic. The only way out was back past him—or deeper into the monastery’s forgotten guts. She chose the latter, edging toward a cracked stairwell that descended into pitch-blackness.\n\nAs she climbed down, the steps groaned beneath her weight. One broke clean through, sending her crashing to the bottom. Pain flared in her ankle, but she forced herself up. The box was still in her grip.\n\nHer flashlight gone, she relied on the faint glow of moonlight filtering through cracks above. And then she saw it: carved into the stone wall of the crypt was a series of symbols identical to those in Ashford’s journal."

Darkness swallowed her whole.\n\nShe pressed against the wall, trembling, her breath ragged. Somewhere in the black corridor ahead, dripping water echoed like a clock counting down.

I know why you’re here.”\n\nEmma’s instincts screamed to retreat, but curiosity anchored her feet. “Who are you?”\n\nA shape moved in the darkness, the faint glow of a lantern illuminating pale skin, sharp eyes, and hair streaked with silver. The woman was older than Emma by at least two decades, but her presence was commanding, magnetic.\n\n“My name is Dr. Lillian Marrow,” she said softly. “Ashford sent you, didn’t he?”\n\nEmma’s breath caught. “You knew him?”\n Marrow nodded. “Better than most. We worked on the same project years ago—the one that cost him his life.”\n\nChapter 8\n\nMarrow led her deeper into the passage. At its end lay a hidden chamber lined with shelves of rotting manuscripts, relics wrapped in cloth, and maps that looked stolen from forgotten archives."

Symbols, codes, histories rewritten by those in power.”\n\nEmma pulled out the journal. “These symbols… they’re on the walls here.”\n Marrow’s eyes gleamed. “Yes. They mark the route to the Vanishing Point.”\n\nEmma froze. The words chilled her.\n “The Vanishing Point?”\n “It’s not a place,” Marrow corrected. “It’s a convergence. A secret people have killed to keep hidden. And now you’re entangled in it, whether you like it or not.”\n\nEmma’s stomach tightened. “And the man following me?”\n Marrow’s expression darkened. “An operative. One of many. They’re part of a faction that has hunted this knowledge for centuries. They’ll kill anyone who gets close.”\n\nChapter 9\n\nEmma’s mind spun. The journal, the box, the monastery, the coded map—it was all leading her toward something monumental. But why her?\n\nMarrow leaned closer. “Ashford trusted you because of your father. You don’t know it yet, but your family’s been tied to this for generations.”"

She couldn’t tell.\n\nMarrow’s lantern flickered, casting long shadows. “You have a choice, Emma. Give me the box, and I’ll protect you. Keep it, and you’ll paint a target on your back until they find you.”\n\nEmma gripped the bag tighter. Every instinct screamed at her not to let it go.\n\n“I’m keeping it,” she said.\n\nMarrow’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. “Then you’d better be prepared for what comes next.”\n\nChapter 10\n\nThe sound of boots striking stone shattered the moment.

Once you’re in, there’s no turning back.”\n\nEmma clutched the journal and the brass box. The weight of it was no longer just physical. It was destiny closing in around her.\n\nAnd in the silence between heartbeats, Emma realized the truth:\n If she wanted to survive, she couldn’t just run anymore. She would have to fight.\n\nChapter 11\n\nThe courtyard was open to the night sky, stone arches cracked and draped with ivy. For a moment, Emma thought they’d escaped—until a shadow detached itself from the monastery wall.\n\nThe scarred man stepped forward, a knife glinting in his hand. Two more figures appeared behind him, armed, their faces hidden beneath hoods.\n\nEmma’s breath caught. “There are more of them?”\n Marrow’s eyes hardened. “Always.”"

If Ashford had died for this, if her father had been entangled in it, then surrendering wasn’t an option.\n\nMarrow stepped between Emma and the men, pulling something from her coat—a compact pistol, its barrel steady despite her calm demeanor.\n “You’ll have to kill us for it,” she said.\n\nThe scarred man smiled. “Gladly.”\n\nChapter 12\n\nThe courtyard exploded into chaos.\n\nThe scarred man lunged, his blade flashing. Marrow fired. The shot cracked like thunder, echoing off the ruined walls. One hooded figure dropped instantly.\n\nEmma stumbled back as the second hooded man charged. Instinct, not training, drove her—she snatched a loose brick from the ground and swung wildly. The man staggered, dazed, giving Marrow enough time to fire again.\n\nThe scarred man didn’t flinch. He moved like a predator, weaving past Marrow’s bullets until he was within arm’s reach. He slashed, grazing her shoulder. She hissed in pain but held her ground."

It was a continuation of the map.\n\nThe scarred man’s eyes widened with hunger. “Finally…”\n\nChapter 13\n\nThat second of distraction was all Emma needed. She kicked the parchment toward Marrow, who scooped it up with her uninjured arm.

The Vanishing Point is closer than anyone imagined.”\n\nEmma, shaking, wiped the dirt from her hands. The weight of what had just happened sank in: men were dead, blood spilled, all because of her refusal to let go.\n\nAnd yet… a fire had been lit inside her. She wasn’t just surviving anymore. She wanted answers.\n\nFor the first time, she looked at Marrow and said, “Then we find it. Whatever it is.”\n\nChapter 14\n\nThe forest pressed close around them, thick with shadows.

They were being hunted.\n\nChapter 15\n\nWhen they finally stumbled upon an abandoned hunting cabin, half-hidden by ivy, Marrow pushed Emma inside and barred the door with a rotting beam.\n\nThe place reeked of mildew and age. A rusted lantern sat on the table, and Emma managed to coax it to life, casting a flickering light across the room.\n\nMarrow spread the parchment across the table. Her hands trembled slightly as she unrolled it, the inked symbols snaking across the surface like veins.\n\n“This is older than Ashford’s journal,” she murmured. “Centuries older. But it’s the same hand.”\n\nEmma studied it. The map wasn’t linear—it was circular, filled with concentric rings of symbols and numbers. At its center was a single Latin word written in bold strokes: Oblivium.\n\n“What does it mean?” Emma asked."

It’s a weapon.”\n\nMarrow nodded slowly. “Exactly.”\n\nChapter 16\n\nThe wind howled against the cabin walls. Emma stared at the parchment, her stomach twisting. If the Vanishing Point could erase entire truths from existence, then the people chasing them weren’t just after power—they were after control of reality itself.\n\nEmma whispered, “Why me? Why am I even part of this?”\n\nMarrow didn’t look up from the parchment. “Because of your father. He wasn’t just a historian, Emma. He was a guardian of these maps.

Emma barely leapt back in time, her heart pounding.\n\nMarrow grabbed her arm. “Quick thinking. But it won’t be the last trap.”\n\nThe corridor narrowed further, walls closing in. Symbols on the walls began to spin, forming patterns that disoriented Emma. She felt her stomach twist and her vision blur.\n\n“You must focus,” Marrow hissed. “The labyrinth reacts to your fear. It tests your mind as well as your body.”\n\nA low rumble echoed through the labyrinth. Ahead, a stone bridge spanned a dark chasm. The bridge had no rails, the stones slick and uneven."

Emma realized the labyrinth was alive in more ways than one — it was anticipating them, reacting to their choices, punishing hesitation.\n\nChapter 28\n\nThe path opened into a circular chamber, its walls covered in murals of past seekers who had entered the Vanishing Point and never returned. At the center stood a figure cloaked in shadow, its form shifting and indistinct.\n\nA deep, resonant voice filled the chamber. “You have reached the threshold. Only the worthy may proceed.”\n\nEmma stepped forward, clutching the parchment. “What… what must we do?”\n\nThe figure raised a hand. Symbols appeared in the air, spinning, forming a complex puzzle that hovered before them. “Prove your intent. Solve the riddle of balance, or be consumed.”\n\nMarrow whispered, “It’s a test… for knowledge and courage combined. One misstep…”"

Are you willing to risk it?”\n\nEmma looked at the parchment. It contained centuries of knowledge, secrets that could change the world. And yet, she knew the path forward might demand she let go of it temporarily.\n\nTaking a deep breath, she placed the parchment in a recessed alcove in the chamber wall.

They were being hunted.\n\nChapter 15\n\nWhen they finally stumbled upon an abandoned hunting cabin, half-hidden by ivy, Marrow pushed Emma inside and barred the door with a rotting beam.\n\nThe place reeked of mildew and age. A rusted lantern sat on the table, and Emma managed to coax it to life, casting a flickering light across the room.\n\nMarrow spread the parchment across the table.

At its center was a single Latin word written in bold strokes: Oblivium.\n\n“What does it mean?” Emma asked."

She glanced at the box—her father’s legacy—and realized it wasn’t just a treasure. It was a key to surviving this trial.\n\nMarrow shouted, “Emma! Focus on the symbols! They respond to intent!”\n\nEmma’s mind raced. The symbols on the walls shimmered brighter under her gaze. She realized the Vanishing Point’s trials weren’t merely physical—they reacted to her will, her choices, and her courage.\n\nThe traitor charged at Marrow, knife raised. Emma spotted a pattern in the glowing symbols on the floor—a sequence that would release a mechanism from the dais. Without hesitation, she pressed her hands against the carved stones.\n\nThe dais vibrated violently. Energy surged through the chamber. A wall of light shot outward, separating them from the scarred man and his ally. The traitor screamed, thrown backward by the force.\n\nMarrow staggered but recovered. “You did it!” she shouted. “The Vanishing Point protects the worthy. It tests, then shields.”\n\nEmma breathed heavily. “But it’s not over… they’ll keep coming.”"

The Vanishing Point had chosen her as its guardian—but it also warned her: every choice from now on could be deadly, and no one could be trusted completely.\n\nChapter 35\n\nThe chamber’s light shifted, illuminating a spiraling staircase carved from stone, descending into utter darkness. Emma clutched the parchment tightly. Each step felt heavier, as if the weight of centuries pressed down on her shoulders.\n\nMarrow followed silently, eyes scanning the walls for traps. “The Vanishing Point doesn’t forgive hesitation,” she warned.\n\nEmma nodded, her jaw tight. “I won’t hesitate.”\n\nThe staircase opened into a cavern larger than any they had seen—a cathedral of stone and crystal, with an energy that hummed through their veins. Symbols floated in the air, pulsing rhythmically. The air itself seemed to thrum with life.\n\nEmma’s voice trembled. “This… this is it. The heart.”"

But I won’t let you destroy it.”\n\nChapter 36\n\nThe scarred man lunged, and Emma dodged instinctively. The floor beneath them shifted violently, revealing spikes that shot upward with lethal precision. Marrow fired at the intruder, but he moved with preternatural speed, weaving through danger as if the traps themselves obeyed him.\n\nEmma’s eyes scanned the chamber, searching for a pattern in the symbols. Suddenly, a realization struck her: the Vanishing Point didn’t just test her body—it tested her decisions under pressure. Every step, every choice, every instinct mattered."

The Vanishing Point responds to intent. Focus!”\n\nEmma took a deep breath. She thought of her father, of Ashford, of all the secrets erased and the knowledge at stake. She stepped onto the central dais, letting the energy flow through her.\n\nThe symbols flared, wrapping around the scarred man like chains of pure light. He struggled, but the Vanishing Point’s power restrained him. Emma’s heart raced—she could feel the repository recognizing her as its guardian.\n\nThe scarred man spat curses, but the chains held. Emma realized: the Vanishing Point didn’t just protect knowledge—it wielded it against those unworthy.\n\nChapter 37\n\nThe cavern trembled as the scarred man broke free of the energy chains, his rage palpable. “You think this place will save you? I’ll destroy it—and you—with it!”"

A sphere of blinding light expanded from the dais, encasing the scarred man, disarming him and knocking him to the ground.\n\nHe struggled, but the energy held him.

She thought of all the people who could misuse it, all the secrets that had been hidden for centuries. She realized the Vanishing Point didn’t just test courage—it tested morality.\n\nWith a steady breath, she placed the box into the pedestal at the center of the dais. A soft hum resonated, and the symbols on the walls absorbed the energy, stabilizing the Vanishing Point. The chamber calmed. The scarred man lay restrained, powerless.\n\nEmma had made her choice: to protect knowledge, not exploit it.\n\nChapter 39\n\nThe cavern’s energy settled. The Vanishing Point’s symbols glowed softly, as if acknowledging Emma as its guardian.
